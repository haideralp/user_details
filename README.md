``` python
a = 7
b = 2
print(a)
print(b)
print(a > b)
print(a < b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)

greeting = "HelloWorld"

# What options are available in python's builtin library: 

print(greeting)
print(greeting.isalpha())
print(greeting.islower())
```

# String Concatenuation and Casting

```
first_name = "James"
last_name = "Bond"
middle_name = "007"
age = 47

print(first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + " " + str(age))
or
print(f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name} {age}")
```

# String Indexing
 
```
Hello World!
01234567891011

NB: Indexing begins with 0 in python.

# print only `world` in a print statement using slicing 
# print 4th letter from left to right - use correct indexing for all statements
# print 7 letter from right to left
# print 6 letter from left to right

print(greeting[:6]:-1])
print(greeting[4])
print(greeting[-7])
print(greeting[6])
```

``` python
